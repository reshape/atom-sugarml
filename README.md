# Atom SugarML

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/reshape/atom-sugarml.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Language support for [sugarml](https://github.com/reshape/sugarml) in [Atom](http://atom.io). Originally converted from the [Atom-Jade](https://github.com/devongovett/atom-jade) package and adapted for SugarML. Still probably could use some touchups.
